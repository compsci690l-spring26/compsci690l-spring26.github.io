      <h2>Assignments</h2>
      <p>
        There will be four written/coding assignments, including Assignment 0. Assignment 0 will be 
        released on February 6 and provides a reference for the overall difficulty of later assignments, 
        as well as expectations for your preliminary knowledge. <strong>Assignment 0 will be automatically 
        full marks if you complete it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent assignments are due approximately three weeks after their release date. 
        All assignments are submitted through Gradescope.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Late/Make-Up Work Policy</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Deadlines for this course are strict.</strong> A submission made just one minute after the 
        deadline will receive zero credit. You are strongly encouraged to submit your work well in advance 
        of any deadline.
      </p>
      <p>
        To provide some flexibility in completing assignments, you have a total of <strong>five 
        free late days</strong> that you can use for submitting assignments only. <strong>The TA must be 
        notified before the due date to use late days.</strong> You will be charged one late day 
        for submitting an assignment within 24 hours after the due date, two late days for submissions made 
        within 48 hours after the due date, and so on. After you have used up your late days, late assignments 
        will not count for credit except in exceptional circumstances (e.g., illness documented by a doctor's note).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Late days apply only to assignments, not to seminars or final project milestones.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Seminars</h2>
      <p>
        Students work in groups of 2–3 to present research papers. There are 3 sessions per week, 
        with each presentation lasting 20 minutes followed by 5 minutes of Q&A. Presentation slides 
        must be uploaded by 3:00 PM on the Monday before the presentation.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Final Research Project</h2>
      <p>
        The final project is the major component of this course, allowing students to explore any topic 
        related to Generative AI. Projects can involve theoretical or practical research. The project is 
        completed <strong>in groups of 3–4 students</strong> (groups must be formed before the proposal deadline) 
        and has the following milestones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Proposal (5%):</strong> Due March 13</li>
        <li><strong>Milestone (5%):</strong> Due April 10</li>
        <li><strong>Final Video & Write-up (30%):</strong> Due May 11</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Students enrolled in this course are encouraged to attend and actively participate in every class 
        meeting. However, you have the option to skip "regular" class meetings (i.e., those without 
        assignments or exams) if necessary. We understand that each student can independently decide how to 
        allocate their time effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that you are responsible for any material covered during classes you miss. If you are 
        unable to attend, it is your duty to obtain missed notes from a classmate and collect any handouts 
        distributed by the instructor. The instructor will not provide class notes or a comprehensive 
        summary of the missed class via email or a brief recap.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
      <p>
        All work submitted in this course must be the student's own. Any instance of academic dishonesty, 
        including plagiarism or unauthorized collaboration, will be dealt with according to the university's 
        academic honesty policy.
      </p>
